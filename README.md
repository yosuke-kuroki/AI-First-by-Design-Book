  <summary><h2>Introduction</h2></summary>

In today‚Äôs rapidly evolving AI landscape, (Generative) AI promises to revolutionize businesses like never before. While it unlocks unparalleled opportunities, it also brings complex challenges in turning this disruptive technology into successful ventures. The key is not just to navigate these challenges but to elevate your organization's AI practices toward "Pragmatic AI"‚Äîwhere AI's promise meets real-world impact.

We define **Pragmatic AI** as _AI that translates AI efforts into  tangible business successes,  leading to increased revenues and market dominance, rather than focusing solely on  model metrics_. 

"AI First by Design" is your guide to Pragmatic AI. It is a practical resource for Executives, Leaders, Startup Founders, partners at VC/PE firms and Builders, focused on running AI initiatives that deliver real business impact.
